									<h5>CLASS</h5>
									<p>
										Frequently meet with your academic advisor.<br><br>
										Don’t be ashamed or shy to visit professors during office hours. Ask many questions but be mindful of leaving enough space for every student.<br><br>
										Use the Liberal Arts requirements and Open Electives to experiment with topics that you may be interested in that are not directly related to your major, you might discover a new passion!<br><br>
										Every quarter, when the time comes, be prepared for the day of registration of classes for the following quarter; spots fill fast! Figure out which classes you need to enroll in beforehand, add them to the course cart on Campus Connect and enroll when you are scheduled to register (it varies).<br><br>
										When choosing classes, we endorse peaking on RateMyProfessors to get an idea of what the professor is like. However, keep in mind that many times the reviews are inaccurate, incomplete, or simply not enough to get a clear idea. Over time, you’ll develop an eye for when to stay away from a class!<br><br>
										Some colleges, like CDM also offer past evaluations for classes. Check out on their respective website to access them.<br><br>
										It’s easy to fall behind: the 10 weeks go fast! Find a system that work for you. Some people like keeping list of tasks to do, divide their classwork in different notebooks, or through online notetaking services, use reminders on their phone or plan out their week/day beforehand.<br><br>
										Keep in mind important dates such as national holidays, beginning of finals week, tuition due and class registration on the official <a href="https://www.depaul.edu/university-catalog/academic-handbooks/graduate/university-information/Pages/academic-calendar.aspx">academic calendar</a>.<br><br>
									</p>
									<h5>SOCIAL &amp; CLASS</h5>
									<p>
										Make sure that you surround yourself with good friends and classmates; it’s always good to have someone to ask for help, advice, or simply have fun with.<br><br>
										Join as many clubs/organizations that remotely interest you; over time, select the ones that you enjoy the most and stick with them. This will give you a chance to meet a variety of people and understand which group/s you enjoy spending most time with.<br><br>
										Don’t be afraid to defend your opinions but try to understand different points of view; college is a great time to form and shape new ideals.<br><br>
										You may encounter times during your first year at any school you attend where you are lonely. We don't want to sugarcoat this. It may be difficult to make friends. This is particularly true for DePaul because it is a commuter school. We highly recommend you join a couple of clubs and organizations as a way to make friends with similar interests as yourself. Please don't just stay in your dorm room or go directly home after class. Take the time to try it and if you don't like it, you don't have to do it again.<br><br>
									</p>
									<h5>JOB</h5>
									<p>
										Go to the career fairs; they are a great way to meet recruiters and practice your soft skills.<br><br>
										If you feel adventurous, join professional groups in the city on Meetup.com to meet with people in the workforce.<br><br>
										Make use of DePaul’s career center for resume and interview tips.<br><br>
										Book a meeting with a DePaul Alumnus through the ASK program.<br><br>
										Don’t be afraid to ask a professor for internship or research opportunities.<br><br>
										Burn-out is real! It's good to be busy, but also try to understand if you are putting too many activities on your plate. <br><br>
										Take breaks from school/work/job hunting every once in a while. That will help you recharge your batteries and focus on the things that really matter to you in life. It’s easy to lose track of them when you are so busy!<br><br>
										Nonetheless, being busy is generally a good thing; college is the perfect time to throw yourself in the mix and grow on a personal and academic level. Experiences (and mistakes) will make you a better person!<br><br>
										Having good greats offers a great presentation to potential employers; but don’t underestimate the power of networking!<br><br>
