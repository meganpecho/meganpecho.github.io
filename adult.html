									<p>Once in college, you are a certified adult-in-training. Some of you may already be certified full-adults due to some earlier life experiences. Some of you absolutely may not want to be an adult at all. Wherever you are in your adulting process, here are some tips and tricks to help you be a successful adult. Because that's what college is all about, figuring out how to behave in the real world.<br><br></p>
									<h5>MONEY</h5>
									<p>
										Check out <a href="https://resources.depaul.edu/financial-fitness/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">DePaul Central</a> if you would like some help with your finances. You can meet one-on-one with one of the counselors and they can help you set up a budget, teach you about personal finances, and things along that line. <br><br>
										
										If you don't want to meet with someone, try making a budget on your own. Money management is a skill that will help you throughout life. And once you move into an apartment where you owe rent and have to bills and purchase groceries all on the income you make working part-time on-campus, that budget will help make sure you don't end up in a tough spot.<br><br>
										
										
									</p>
									<h5>HEALTH</h5>
									<p>
										Please take care of yourself. Don't pull all-nighters. Sleep is an essential part of being healthy.<br><br>
										
										Also don't stress out too much. It's just college. Yes you are spending a lot of money to be there. But most things are not worth the stress you put on yourself.<br><br>
										
										If you do feel sick, you can visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://offices.depaul.edu/student-affairs/support-services/health-wellness/Pages/health-services.aspx">Presence Sage Medical Center</a> on campus.<br><br>
										
										Take care of yourself. Take care of each other. Take care DePaul. <br><br>
									</p>
									<h5>APARTMENT</h5>
									<p>
										If you go to DePaul and live on campus your first year, you will most likely end up renting an apartment for the rest of your time at DePaul. Especially once you figure out how much cheaper it is. <br><br>
										
										When deciding on a place to live, consider how long you are willing for your commute to class to be. Can you live with roommates and do you think you could live with them for a year without ruining the friendship? Visit a couple of places to get a feel for what you like and don't like. Start looking about 3 months before you need the apartment.<br><br>
									</p>
									<h5>COMMUTE</h5>
									<p>
										Commuting is an inevitable for almost everyone in life at some point, whether for school or for a job. If your friends poke fun at you being a commuter or pity you for it, just know that they will most likely be in the same boat as you after graduation. At least you'll be used to it by then.<br><br>
										
										Make some friends with couches you can crash on. It's super helpful for crunch times, like finishing projects and finals, or if it's cold and you don't want to commute home and hour and a half at midnight in 20 degree weather.<br><br>
